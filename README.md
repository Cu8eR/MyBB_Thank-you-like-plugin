<strong>Thank you/like plugin</strong>
====================
- This is one of the best plugins for MyBB. It needs some love, so we (<strong>Eldenroot</strong>, <strong>SvePu</strong>, <strong>Whiteneo</strong> and <strong>Laird</strong>) decided to fix known bugs and make it even better. We have added many useful features including MyAlerts support. Give it a try and let us know what you think!
